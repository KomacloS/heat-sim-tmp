# Laser-Pad-Thermal

This repository contains a small Streamlit demo for heating a circular copper pad using a lumped thermal model (Milestone 1).

The pad properties are computed from its diameter and thickness. Temperature rise is integrated in time assuming all laser power is absorbed.

Run the interactive demo with:

```bash
poetry run streamlit run demos/demo_m1.py
```

Running it directly with `poetry run demo-m1` executes in **bare mode**,
which still works but prints several warnings.

For the spatially resolved transient solver (Milestone&nbsp;2):

```bash
poetry run streamlit run demos/demo_m2.py
```

Milestones 3â€“5 extend the solver with beam-shape effects,
multilayer stacks, and PCB traces. Launch them via

```bash
poetry run streamlit run demos/demo_m3.py
poetry run streamlit run demos/demo_m4.py
poetry run streamlit run demos/demo_m5.py
```

Run the test suite with:

```bash
poetry run pytest -q
```
