# Laser-Pad-Thermal

This repository contains a small Streamlit demo for heating a circular copper pad using a lumped thermal model (Milestone 1).

The pad properties are computed from its diameter and thickness. Temperature rise is integrated in time assuming all laser power is absorbed.

Run the interactive demo with:

```bash
poetry run demo-m1
```
