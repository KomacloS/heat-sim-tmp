# Laser-Pad-Thermal

Milestone 1 – heat-transfer demo.

The solver is validated by checking internal energy balance rather than
matching an analytic profile. Tests ensure the temperature decreases
monotonically from the inner rim and that the convective loss at the
outer boundary balances the imposed heat flux to within 1%.
